### 📋 Code Guidelines

#### **Romantic Coding Standards**
- Use relationship metaphors consistently
- Write code that tells a love story
- Comment your code as if explaining to your significant other
- Test thoroughly - we want stable relationships! 
- Keep functions small and focused (like perfect date plans)

#### **Naming Conventions**
- Variables: `camelCase` (e.g., `myLoveStory`, `firstDate`)
- Functions: `snake_case` with romantic names (e.g., `propose_marriage`, `calculate_love_score`)
- Constants: `UPPER_CASE` (e.g., `ETERNAL_LOVE`, `MAX_ROMANCE_LEVEL`)

#### **Example Code Style**
```couplescript
# Good: Romantic and clear
marry couple_names couple["Alice", "Bob"]
propose plan_perfect_date(location, activity):
    marry date_plan memory[
        "location": location,
        "activity": activity,
        "romance_level": 100
    ]
    promise date_plan

# Comments should be loving and helpful
# This function calculates the compatibility between two people
propose calculate_compatibility(person1, person2):
    # Love always finds a way! 💕
    promise love
```
